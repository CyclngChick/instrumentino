Created in Gimp, v2.8

Master Layer: 
    Width: 512px
    Height: 256px
    Note: Subsequent sizes scale from master by dividing height by 2.

Background: 
    Color: "Instrumentino White": f8f8f8

Sine wave: 
    Height: 236px
    Width: 236px
    Color: "Instrumentino Blue compliment (Orange)": ff9c30

Square wave: same as sine wave except
    Color: "Instrumentino Blue": 33b5e5

Note:
    Left sine/square tools: Position: 10x,10y
    Right sine/square tools: Position: 246x, 10y

Note: To fill circle/square: 
    Set pencil tool to appropriate color and 12 px wide brush
    Select -> to path
    Edit -> stroke selection -> pencil tool
    Note: Stroke selection draws in center of line

Note: Once layers are all built, flatten then into a new layer then center the graphics using the "centering/center line" layer.  Didn't want to go through all the motions to place them pixel perfectly just yet.
