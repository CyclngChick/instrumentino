Instrumentino
=============

Instrumentino is an open-source modular graphical user interface framework for controlling Arduino based experimental instruments

It consists of two separate programs:
- instrumentino: which is run on a PC and provides the graphical user interface.
- controlino:    which is the program running on the Arduino controller itself, and is used to communicate with instrumentino.

See the documents library for further instructions and examples.
